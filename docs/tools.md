# PagerDuty MCP Tools
The MCP server tools below expose PagerDuty API functionality to LLMs. These tools are designed to be used programmatically, with structured inputs and outputs.

## User Context
The MCP server tools use a user context to filter resources based on the current user's permissions. The user context contains:
- `user_id` (str): The current user's PagerDuty ID
- `team_ids` (List[str]): List of team IDs the user belongs to
- `service_ids` (List[str]): List of service IDs the user has access to
- `escalation_policy_ids` (List[str]): List of escalation policy IDs the user is part of

Many tools accept a `current_user_context` parameter (defaults to `True`) which automatically filters results based on this context. When `current_user_context` is `True`, you cannot use `user_ids`, `team_ids`, or `service_ids` parameters as they would conflict with the automatic filtering.

## Response Format
All API responses follow a consistent format:
```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "count": <count>,
    "description": "<A short summary of the results>"
  },
  <resource_type>: [ // Always pluralized for consistency, even if only one result is returned
    {
      ...
    },
    ...
  ],
  "error": {  // Only present if there's an error
    "message": "<error description>",
    "code": "<error code>"
  }
}
```

Note that `show_` methods still return lists in the format above, even though there will only be 1 list element, to ensure consistent response structure across queries.

### Error Handling
When an error occurs, the response will include an error object with the following structure:
```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "count": 0,
    "description": "Error occurred while processing request"
  },
  "error": {
    "message": "Invalid user ID provided",
    "code": "INVALID_USER_ID"
  }
}
```

Common error scenarios include:
- Invalid resource IDs (e.g., user_id, team_id, service_id)
- Missing required parameters
- Invalid parameter values
- API request failures
- Response processing errors

### Parameter Validation
- All ID parameters must be valid PagerDuty resource IDs
- Date parameters must be valid ISO8601 timestamps
- List parameters (e.g., `statuses`, `team_ids`) must contain valid values
- Invalid values in list parameters will be ignored
- Required parameters cannot be `None` or empty strings
- For `statuses` in `list_incidents`, only `triggered`, `acknowledged`, and `resolved` are valid values
- For `urgency` in incidents, only `high` and `low` are valid values

## Escalation Policy Tools
Tools for interacting with PagerDuty Escalation Policies. An Escalation Policy determines what User or Schedule will be Notified and in what order. This will happen when an Incident is triggered. Escalation Policies can be used by one or more Services.

### list_escalation_policies

## Incidents Tools
Tools for interacting with PagerDuty incidents. An Incident represents a problem or an issue that needs to be addressed and resolved.
Incidents can be thought of as a problem or an issue within your Service that needs to be addressed and resolved, they are normalized and de-duplicated.
Incidents can be triggered, acknowledged, or resolved, and are assigned to a User based on the Service's Escalation Policy.
A triggered Incident prompts a Notification to be sent to the current On-Call User(s) as defined in the Escalation Policy used by the Service.
Incidents are triggered through the Events API or are created by Integrations.

### list_incidents
List existing incidents.

## On-Call Tools
Tools for interacting with PagerDuty On-Calls. An On-Call represents a contiguous unit of time for which a User will be On-Call for a given Escalation Policy and Escalation Rule.
This may be the result of that User always being On-Call for the Escalation Rule, or a block of time during which the computed result of a Schedule on that Escalation Rule puts the User On-Call.
During an On-Call, the User is expected to bear responsibility for responding to any Notifications they receives and working to resolve the associated Incident(s).
On-Calls cannot be created directly through the API; they are the computed result of how Escalation Policies and Schedules are configured. The API provides read-only access to the On-Calls generated by PagerDuty.

### list_oncalls
List existing on-call entries.

#### Parameters
| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| **current_user_context** | `bool` | No | If `True`, filters on-calls to those associated with the current user. Cannot be used with `user_ids`. |
| **schedule_ids** | `List[str]` | No | Filter on-calls by specific schedule IDs. |
| **user_ids** | `List[str]` | No | Filter on-calls by specific user IDs. Cannot be used with `current_user_context`. |
| **escalation_policy_ids** | `List[str]` | No | Filter on-calls by specific escalation policy IDs. |
| **since** | `str` | No | Start of date range in ISO8601 format. Default is 1 month ago. |
| **until** | `str` | No | End of date range in ISO8601 format. Default is now. |

#### Returns
Dict[str, Any]: A dictionary containing metadata and a list of on-call entries in the following format:
- `metadata` (Dict): Contains result count and a description of the query results.
- `oncalls` (List[Dict]): A list of parsed on-call objects.

Each on-call object contains:
- `id` (str): The unique identifier for the on-call entry.
- `summary` (str): Summary of the on-call entry.
- `start` (str): Start time of the on-call period.
- `end` (str): End time of the on-call period.
- `user` (Dict): The user who is on-call.
- `escalation_policy` (Dict): The escalation policy this on-call is for.
- `escalation_level` (int): The escalation level for this on-call.
- `schedule` (Dict): The schedule that generated this on-call (if applicable).

#### Example Response
```json
{
    "metadata": {
        "count": 2,
        "description": "Found 2 results for resource type oncalls"
    },

            "schedule": {...}
        }
    ]
}
```

#### Example Queries
Here are common ways an LLM might want to query on-calls:

1. List current on-call entries (filtering by current user's user_id):
```python
list_oncalls()
```

2. List all on-calls for a specific schedule during a specified time frame:
```python
list_oncalls(
    schedule_ids=['SCHEDULE_123'],  # Example PagerDuty schedule ID
    since="2025-02-27T20:48:23.358605Z",

Only On-Call Users are eligible to receive Notifications from Incidents.
The details of the On-Call Schedule specify which single User is On-Call for that Schedule at any given point in time.
An On-Call Schedule consists of one or more Schedule Layers that rotate a group of Users through the same shift at a set interval.
Schedules are used by Escalation Policies as an escalation target for a given Escalation Rule.
